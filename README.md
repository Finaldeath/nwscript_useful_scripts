# nwscript Utility Scripts
A repository of various useful utility scripts for Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition (although some will be compatible with NWN Diamond 1.69) that are too small for their own repository. Feel free to submit changes.

# Example and style guide
This repository will be following the rough Bioware style guide, so it's Camel Case and commented for use in the toolset. Look in the "Style Guide" folder for more information.

# Licence
I put an MIT licence so it's permissive for any use.
