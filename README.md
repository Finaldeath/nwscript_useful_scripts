# nwscript Utility Scripts
A repository of various useful utility scripts for Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition (although some will be compatible with NWN Diamond 1.69) that are too small for their own repository. Feel free to submit changes or ask for links to be added here in the NWvault Discord.

These scripts may well be more useful if you just take snippets of them. There may be some overlapping functionality. Some files will have full libraries, some have a mismash collection of functions.

# Example and style guide
This repository will be following the rough Bioware style guide, so it's Camel Case and commented for use in the toolset. Look in the "Style Guide" folder for more information.

# Other Utilities

These are other utilities or libraries that may be of interest:

* [Squatting Monk's Utilties](https://github.com/squattingmonk/sm-utils) - Someo of these concepts may be adapted here, but are great standalone!
* [Awsome NWNX](https://github.com/nwnxee/unified/blob/master/Awesome-NWNX.md) - A huge number of other NWN related resources

# Licence
I put an MIT licence so it's permissive for any use.
